            <h2 id="shell-model">Shell model</h2>
            <p>So far we have investigated the mass and stability of nuclei, now we want to explore the structure of the nucleus in more details. We understand the effects of the mass number <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and the number of protons and neutrons <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> on the strength of the binding of the nuclei but when we look at the energy it takes to excite nuclei to their first excited state we see that the largest excitation energies are concentrated around specific values of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, see Figure fig. 9.</p>
            <div class="figure">
            <img src="/images/firstExcitedStateEnergyWithLegend.png" alt="Figure 9: First excited state energy. The highest energies (and hence the most stable states) are concentrated around proton and neutron numbers equal to 2,8,20,28,50,82,126" id="fig:firstExcited" />
            <p class="caption">Figure 9: First excited state energy. The highest energies (and hence the most stable states) are concentrated around proton and neutron numbers equal to 2,8,20,28,50,82,126</p>
            </div>
            <p>These numbers are called “magic” numbers. The shell model can explain these numbers. We already observed that the binding energy per nucleon had enhancements around the places corresponding to one of the proton or neutron number close to a magic number.</p>
            <p>For the shell model we consider a nucleon moving in the potential generated by the other nucleons. The potential will have discrete energy levels and since the nucleons are fermions there will be at most two nucleons in the same state. Since protons and neutrons are different fermion this limitation is only acting on the protons and neutrons as separate groups so we will get separate spectra for each type of nucleon. We assume that the nuclear potential is spherically symmetric so the wave functions can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics. The solutions can be labelled by two quantum numbers, one enumerating the solutions of the radial wave-function, <span class="math inline">\(n=1,2,3,...\)</span> and the angular momentum <span class="math inline">\(l=0,1,2,3,...\)</span>. We will use the spectroscopic nomenclature <span class="math inline">\(l=s,p,d,f,...\)</span> to label the orbital momentum quantum number.</p>
            <p>If the potential can be approximated by an harmonic oscillator the energy would be given by the usual <span class="math display">\[E=\left(2n+l-\frac{1}{2}\right)\omega\]</span> If we approximate it as an infinite well potential we obtain the levels depicted in Figure fig. 10.</p>
            <div class="figure">
            <img src="/images/harmonicSWplusSpinCoupling.png" alt="Figure 10: Energy levels in an infinite potential well, in the Saxon-Woods potential before and after including the spin-orbit coupling. Figure taken form Lilley (2009), p.48." id="fig:levels" />
            <p class="caption">Figure 10: Energy levels in an infinite potential well, in the Saxon-Woods potential before and after including the spin-orbit coupling. Figure taken form <span class="citation">Lilley (2009)</span>, p.48.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Unfortunately the actual nuclear potential is neither harmonic nor an infinite well. Since the nuclear force is very short range, the potential it creates should follow the density of nucleons in the nucleus. We will see later which form this density takes and how to measure it. Empirically we can use the following form <span class="math display">\[V(r)=-\frac{V_0}{1+e^{(r-r_0)/a}}\]</span> with parameters <span class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> fitted from data. With this potential we obtain the levels shown in the central part of Figure fig. 10. This potential alone is not enough to describe the features that the mass spectrum of nuclides displays. Although the first magic numbers are predicted properly the gap between energy levels do not line up properly to explain the higher magic numbers.</p>
            <p>To achieve the agreement with the data we need to consider an addition to the potential: the spin-orbit coupling. In the hydrogen atom electron energy levels the interaction caused by the spin-orbit term in the potential is responsible for the hydrogen fine structure. In the hydrogen case it is not a large effect. In the case of the shell model of the nucleus the effect is larger and does not only creates a splitting but actually reorders shells of different <span class="math inline">\(n.l\)</span> quantum numbers, which places the gabs in the energy levels at the right place to explain the magic numbers. The spin-orbit coupling term is given by <span class="math display">\[V_{SO}=V_{ls}(r)\left&lt;\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}\right&gt;\]</span> We can calculate the expectation value of the expectation value of <span class="math inline">\(\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}\)</span> as a function of the eigenvalues of the total angular momentum <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[j(j+1)=\left&lt;\vec{j}^2\right&gt;=\left&lt;(\vec{l}+\vec{s})^2\right&gt;
            =
            \left&lt;\vec{l}^2+2\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}+\vec{s}^2\right&gt;
            =l(l+1)+s(s+1)+2\left&lt;\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}\right&gt;\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\Rightarrow
            \left&lt;\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}\right&gt;=\frac{j(j+1)-l(l+1)-s(s+1)}{2}\]</span> according to the rules of angular momentum addition the possible values of <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are either <span class="math inline">\(l+1/2\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(l-1/2\)</span> so we get <span class="math display">\[\left&lt;\vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}\right&gt;=\left\{\begin{array}{rcc}
            l/2&amp;\mbox{for}&amp; j=l+1/2\\
            -(l+1)/2&amp;\mbox{for}&amp; j=l-1/2
            \end{array}\right.\]</span> As for the hydrogen atom, we can now label the levels with <span class="math inline">\(n,l\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. The quantum number <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> determines the parity of the state. The energy split between the two <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> levels is given by <span class="math display">\[\Delta E_{SO,ls}=\left&lt;V_{ls}(r) \vec{l}\cdot\vec{s}\right&gt;=
            \left(\frac{l}{2}-\frac{-(l+1)}{2}\right)=\left&lt;V_{ls}(r)\right&gt;\frac{2l+1}{2}\]</span> We find experimentally that the coefficient <span class="math inline">\(\left&lt;V_{ls}(r)\right&gt;\)</span> is negative so that unlike for the electron levels in the hydrogen the energy level with the higher value of <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> is the lower lying one. The result of including this contribution is shown on the right of Figure fig. 10 and result in splits between levels consistent with the magic numbers.</p>
            <p>In practice the proton and neutron potentials can have slightly different shapes resulting in small differences in the ordering of the shells within a band, but not affecting the magic numbers, see Figure fig. 11.</p>
            <div class="figure">

            <p class="caption">Figure 11: Energy levels for protons and neutrons. The ordering within a band are different for higher levels, but the structure in bands with magic number of nucleons is the same.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The shell model is successful at explaining the magic numbers, but it can also predict (albeit with less success) the spin and parity of the nuclei.</p>
            <h2 id="spin-and-parity-of-nuclei">Spin and parity of nuclei</h2>
            <p>Assuming that the potential is spherically symmetric we could express the angular part of the wave functions to be spherical harmonics <span class="math inline">\(Y_{l,m}(\theta,\phi)\)</span>. These functions behaves as <span class="math display">\[Y_{l,m}(\theta,\phi)\rightarrow (-1)^l Y_{l,m}(\theta,\phi)\]</span> under the parity transformation <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{P}\)</span> that takes <span class="math inline">\(\vec{r}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(-\vec{r}\)</span>. Experimental evidence supports the fact that the strong and electromagnetic forces conserve parity so we can expect parity to be a conserved quantum number for the nucleus states. With our labelling with <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> the parity of a state can be directly read off as <span class="math inline">\((-1)^l\)</span>.</p>
            <p>If a shell is full we expect all contributions to the angular momentum to cancel out and the parity to be <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> as there is an even number of particles in the full shell. Let’s now look at what happens if we have a full shells up to one additional nucleon. We can apply our “one particle in the potential of the other” analysis of the shell model and predict that the spin and parity of the nucleus will be determined by the parity and angular momentum of this nucleon, so the spin will be <span class="math inline">\(0,1,2,3,...\)</span> if the single nucleon is in a <span class="math inline">\(s,p,d,f,...\)</span> state. Its parity will be <span class="math inline">\((-1)^l\)</span>, that is <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(s,d,g,..\)</span> shells and <span class="math inline">\((-1)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(p,f,h,...\)</span> shells.</p>
            <p>If we have full shells up to one missing nucleon, then the spin and parity will be determined by the angular momentum and parity of the missing nucleon (often referred to as “hole”).</p>
            <p>Using the fact that nucleons tend to pair we can extend this analysis to shells that are further to being full than by one nucleon. We can assume that the contributions from paired nucleons will cancel and only the unpaired nucleon contributes to the spin and parity of the nucleus.</p>
            <p>The shell model gives predictions for even-even nuclei: they will all have <span class="math inline">\(J^P=0^+\)</span>, for odd-even nuclei the spin and parity is given by the odd nucleon. The situation is more complicated for odd-odd nuclei where no clear prediction can be made from the shell model.</p>

            </div>
            <p>With the shell model we can also explain some of the spin and parity of excited levels of nuclei. Figure fig. 12 shows the energies and <span class="math inline">\(J^P\)</span> quantum numbers of excitations of nuclei with proton and neutron numbers close to the magical number <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>. Let us look at these nuclei in turn. <span class="math inline">\(\ce{^{16}O}\)</span> has full shells for both neutrons and nucleons. It is therefore very stable and its ground state has <span class="math inline">\(J^P=0^+\)</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="math inline">\(\ce{^{15}N}\)</span> has 8 neutrons so the neutron <span class="math inline">\(1s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1p\)</span> shells are full. It has 7 protons so we have a full <span class="math inline">\(1s\)</span> shell, a full <span class="math inline">\(1p_{3/2}\)</span> shell but a hole in the <span class="math inline">\(1p_{1/2}\)</span> shell. We therefore expect the spin and parity of the ground state to be <span class="math inline">\(J=1/2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P=(-1)^1=-1\)</span>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
            <p><span class="math inline">\(\ce{^{15}O}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ce{^{17}N}\)</span> are called <em>mirror nuclei</em> because they map into each other through swapping the protons with neutrons.</p>
            <h2 id="excited-states">Excited states</h2>
            <p>Nuclei have many excited states. We have seen that some of them can be explained by the shell model. There are also other excited states that correspond to vibrational or rotational excitations.</p>
            <p>An excited nucleus can relax into its ground state through emission of a photon. Conversely a photon can be absorbed to move such a system from one energy state to a higher one. In this section we will consider the case of a decay, the discussion of the other case is similar. The relevant ingredient for this process are the parity, spin, orbital and total angular momentum of the initial and final states. The emitted photon can (actually it has to) carry away some angular momentum, we denote this amount with <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>. It is related to the multipolarity of the radiation: <span class="math inline">\(\ell=1\)</span> is called dipole radiation, <span class="math inline">\(\ell=2\)</span> quadrupole, <span class="math inline">\(\ell=3\)</span> octopole, etc. Angular momentum has to be conserved, so we have <span class="math display">\[\vec J_p=\vec J_d+\vec \ell\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\vec J_p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\vec J_d\)</span> the total angular momentum of the parent and daughter states. Because of this constraint we have <span class="math display">\[|J_p-J_d|\leq \ell \leq J_p+J_d \;.\]</span> It is important to note that this equation leads to results that can appear counter-intuitive. For example for <span class="math inline">\(J_p=J_d=1\)</span> we can have <span class="math inline">\(\ell=2\)</span>. It would appear that the angular momentum did not change and yet the photon carries some angular momentum away. The important point is that this is a vector equation and in this case <span class="math inline">\(\vec J_p=-\vec J_d\)</span> and while they have the same norm their angular momentum did change as a vector. In other words one can have <span class="math inline">\(\Delta J=0\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \vec J\neq 0\)</span>.</p>
            <p>There are two ways for the initial state to change its angular momentum, it can change its spin or change its orbital angular momentum. If a spin change has occurred, the transition is classed as “magnetic” if not it is called “electric”. A transition with change on angular momentum <span class="math inline">\(\ell=|\vec{\ell}|\)</span> is labelled <span class="math inline">\(E\ell\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(M\ell\)</span> if it is electric or magnetic. It turns out that the matrix element for a change of spin is typically smaller than that of changing the orbital momentum, so magnetic transitions are normally less likely than the electric transitions for the same <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>. The higher <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> is the least likely the transition is so that transitions will normally take part with the lowest <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> allowed by the conservation constraints.</p>
            <p>Let us now consider the effect of parity. To calculate the parity of the final state we have to combine the parity of the daughter state <span class="math inline">\(P_d\)</span> and the parity of the EM radiation. The parity of the EM radiation depends on whether its origin is electric or magnetic. It is <span class="math inline">\((-1)^\ell\)</span> for an electric transition and <span class="math inline">\((-1)^{\ell+1}\)</span> for magnetic transitions. So we have for the parity <span class="math inline">\(P_p\)</span> of the parent state: <span class="math display">\[P_p=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
            P_d(-1)^\ell&amp;\mbox{for $E$ transitions}\\
            P_d(-1)^{\ell+1}&amp;\mbox{for $M$ transitions}
            \end{array}\right.\]</span></p>
            <p>The above facts give us the following selection rules for <span class="math inline">\(\ell=1\)</span> transitions: <span class="math display">\[|J_i-J_f|\leq 1\leq J_f+J_i \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad P_p=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
            -P_d&amp;\mbox{for an $E1$ transition}\\
            +P_d&amp;\mbox{for a $M1$ transition}\end{array}\right.\]</span> That is the difference between the <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> values of the daughter and parent states cannot be larger than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> (so it can be <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>) and their sum has to be larger than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. For an electric transition this is accompanied by a change of parity and for a magnetic transition the parity of the daughter particle has to be the same as that of the parent.</p>
            <p>Let us now look at <span class="math inline">\(\ell=2\)</span> transitions. The above facts give us the following selection rules: <span class="math display">\[|J_i-J_f|\leq 2\leq J_f+J_i \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad P_p=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}
            +P_d&amp;\mbox{for an $E2$ transition}\\
            -P_d&amp;\mbox{for a $M2$ transition}\end{array}\right.\]</span> That is the difference between the <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> values of the daughter and parent states cannot be larger than <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> are possible), and their sum has to be larger than <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. For a magnetic transition this is accompanied by a change of parity and for an electric transition the parity of the daughter particle has to be the same as that of the parent.</p>
            <p>Given a parent and a daughter states, one can find the transitions by first listing all allowed <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> according to <span class="math display">\[|J_i-J_f|\leq \ell\leq J_f+J_i\;;\]</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> only one of the <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> transitions will be allowed by parity. If a <span class="math inline">\(E\ell\)</span> transition is allowed, parity will allow transitions <span class="math inline">\(E(\ell\pm2),E(\ell\pm4)...\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M(\ell\pm1),M(\ell\pm3)...\)</span>, but angular momentum conservation will not allow all of them. We will often find situations where <span class="math inline">\(E\ell\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M(\ell\pm1)\)</span> are allowed and wonder which one is most likely. The case <span class="math inline">\(E\ell/M(\ell+1)\)</span> is easy as <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> transitions are more likely than <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> transitions and the likelihood is decreasing strongly with increasing <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>. The other case with <span class="math inline">\(M\ell\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E(\ell+1)\)</span> is more complicated and the two can be of similar size, leading to interference effects.</p>

Since we have a constant density, the radius as a function of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is given by <span class="math display">\[\rho=\frac{3 z}{4\pi r(z)^3}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad r(z)=\left(\frac{3z}{4\pi\rho}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}\]</span> To obtain the total energy we need to integrate <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> from 0 to the total charge: <span class="math display">\[E=\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int\limits_0^{Z}\left(\frac{4\pi\rho}{3}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}z^{2/3}\,dz=\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \left(\frac{4\pi\rho}{3}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}\frac{3}{5}Z^{5/3}\]</span> The density <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is given by: <span class="math display">\[\rho=\frac{3Z}{4\pi R^3}\,,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the radius of the nucleus. Plugging this in we get: <span class="math display">\[E=\frac{3\alpha Z^2}{5 R}\]</span> which has the almost the right <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> dependence. The difference with the term in the semi-empirical formula eq. eq. 1 is that in this calculation we have accounted for the energy to “assemble” a proton, but this energy is already present in the mass of the proton so we are slightly overestimating the Coulomb energy.</p>
