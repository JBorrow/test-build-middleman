            <h2 id="quark-structure-of-the-nucleons">Quark structure of the nucleons</h2>
            <p>We now know that the charged constituents are quarks and that we can rewrite the structure function as <span class="math display">\[F_2(x)=x\sum\limits_{f}Q_f^2(q_f(x)+\bar q_f(x)\;,\]</span> where the sum runs over the quark flavours. The <span class="math inline">\(c,b,t\)</span> quarks are too heavy to play a significant role in DIS experiments so we can limit the sum to the three lighter quarks <span class="math inline">\(u,d,s\)</span>. The neutrons and protons are made up of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> quarks, but no <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> quarks, so the <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> quarks only appear in the sea quark distribution. Separating each quark parton distribution function into a valence and a sea contribution we can write down the structure function for the scattering of an electron off a proton: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            \label{eq:F2ep}
            F_2^{e,p}(x)&amp;=&amp;x\sum\limits_{f=u,d,s}Q_f^2(q_f(x)+\bar q_f(x))\\
            &amp;=&amp;x\left[
            \frac{1}{9}\left(d_V^p+d_S^{p}+\bar d_S^p\right)+
            \frac{4}{9}\left(u_V^p+u_S^{p}+\bar u_S^p\right)+
            \frac{1}{9}\left(s_S^{p}+\bar s_S^p\right)
            \right]\;,\end{aligned}\]</span> where the argument <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> of the distributions <span class="math inline">\(q_f(x)\)</span>A has been omitted for readability. A proton and a neutron differ by the fact that the roles of the <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> quarks are inverted. We will see later that the relative similarity of the proton and neutron, called isospin symmetry, is a useful tool to understand the structure of baryons. Here we will only use the approximate symmetry between the neutron and the proton to argue that the distributions of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> in the proton and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> in the neutron should be the same, and reciprocally. <span class="math display">\[u_V^p\simeq d_V^n\;, d_V^p\simeq u_V^n\;, s_S^p(x)\simeq s_S^{n}(x)\;.\]</span> Using this approximation we can write the expression for the structure function for the electron scattering off a neutron. <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            \label{eq:F2en}
            F_2^{e,n}(x)&amp;=&amp;x\left[
            \frac{1}{9}\left(d_V^n+d_S^{n}+\bar d_S^n\right)+
            \frac{4}{9}\left(u_V^n+u_S^{n}+\bar u_S^n\right)+
            \frac{1}{9}\left(s_S^{n}+\bar s_S^n\right)
            \right]\\
            &amp;=&amp;x
            \left[
            \frac{1}{9}\left(u_V^p+u_S^{p}+\bar u_S^p\right)+
            \frac{4}{9}\left(d_V^n+d_S^{p}+\bar d_S^p\right)+
            \frac{1}{9}\left(s_S^{p}+\bar s_S^p\right)
            \right]\;,\end{aligned}\]</span> where we have used the above approximation to rewrite the neutron parton distributions in terms of the proton ones. If our target consists of and equal amount of protons and neutron, we can measure the average nucleon structure function bu averaging equations (eq. <strong>??</strong>) and (eq. <strong>??</strong>): <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
            \label{eq:F2eN}
            F_2^{e,N}(x)&amp;=&amp;\frac{F_2^{e,p}+F_2^{e,n}}{2}=x\left[
            \frac{5}{18}\left(d_V^n+d_S^{n}+\bar d_S^n\right)+
            \frac{5}{18}\left(u_V^n+u_S^{n}+\bar u_S^n\right)+
            \frac{1}{9}\left(s_S^{n}+\bar s_S^n\right)
            \right]\;.\end{aligned}\]</span> If we change the incoming particle instead of the target we can also calculate the structure function for the scattering of a neutrino with nucleons. This time the interaction is the weak interaction instead of the electro-magetic force. The structure function is given by <span class="math display">\[
            F_2^{\nu,N}=x\sum\limits_f\left(q_f(x)+\bar q_f(x)\right)\;.
            \qquad(11)\]</span> If we neglect the <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-quark contribution we find <span class="math display">\[\frac{F_2^{2,N}(x)}{F_2^{nu,N}}=\frac{5}{18}\;.\]</span> This result is confirmed by the experiment, as shown in figure fig. 15.</p>

            <h3 id="momentum-distribution">Momentum distribution</h3>
            <p>We have seen that the parton distribution functions <span class="math inline">\(f_c(x)\)</span> give the probability of finding a parton with a momentum fraction <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> of the proton momentum <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. We can estimate the momentum <span class="math inline">\(p_f\)</span> carried by the quarks and anti-quarks of flavour <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[p_f=\int\limits_0^1dx\;\left(q_f(x)+\bar q_f(x)\right)\,xP\;.\]</span> So the fraction of the total proton momentum carried by the quarks is given by <span class="math display">\[\frac{\sum_f p_f}{P}=\int\limits_0^1 dx\, x \left(q_f(x)+\bar q_f(x)\right)=\int\limits_0^1 dx\, F_2^{\nu,N}(x)=\frac{18}{5} \int\limits_0^1 dx\,F_2^{e,N}(x)\;.\]</span> If there were only quarks and anti-quarks in the proton we would expect this fraction to be <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> but experimentally it is found to be close to <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span>, so we can conclude that there are other partons in the proton that do not interact either electro-magnetically (with the electrons) or weakly (with the neutrinos). These particles are the gluons.</p>
            <h2 id="colour">Colour</h2>
            <p>The <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> quarks were originally introduced as a theoretical device to help understanding the properties of the baryons (as we will see in a later section), Only later were they discovered to actually correspond to actual particles.</p>
            <p>One of the baryons is the <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^{++}\)</span> resonance, it has charge <span class="math inline">\(+2\)</span> and is composed of three valence <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> quarks. It has a spin of <span class="math inline">\(3/2\)</span> and has positive parity. With our current understanding of the quarks we run into difficulties to describe the <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^{++}\)</span> wave-function: we have the following constraints on the wave function</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Since we have spin <span class="math inline">\(3/2\)</span> all <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> spins <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> of the quarks have to be aligned, so the spin wave function has to be symmetric</p></li>
            <li><p>Since the three valence quarks are <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> quarks the flavour part of the wave function has to be symmetric</p></li>
            <li><p>The <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^{++}\)</span> resonance is the lightest spin <span class="math inline">\(3/2\)</span> baryon so the most likely orbital wave function is one with no orbital angular momentum between the valence quark. Such a wave function is symmetric</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>All these constraints imply that the wave function of the <span class="math inline">\(Delta^{++}\)</span> resonance is fully symmetric, but this is in contradiction with the Pauli exclusion principle that states that a state made up of fermions (and <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> quarks are fermions) should be anti-symmetric with respect to the exchange of any two identical fermion. This problem can be resolved by adding a quantum number to the quarks such that their state can be anti-symmetric with respect to that quantum number and therefore overall anti-symmetric with respect to the exchange of two quarks.</p>
            <p>The quantum number we introduce is called the <em>colour</em>. The colour charge can take on three different values that we call red, green or blue and denote with <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Anti-quark carry anti-colour charges denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\bar r\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bar g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\bar b\)</span>. The strong force is the interaction between colour charges and is carried by the gluons. It turns out that the gluons also carry colour charges, namely a colour-anticolour combination, for example <span class="math inline">\(r\bar g\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\bar r\)</span>...</p>
            <p>The interaction with the gluon changes the colour of the quark, as illustrated in figure fig. 16. Since the gluons carry colour charges they can also interact with themselves. The colour exchanges in such an interaction is illustrated in figure fig. 16. The fact that this interaction makes the strong interaction very different from the the electro-magnetic force.</p>
            <p>While the electro-magnetic interaction is <em>screening</em>, that is vacuum fluctuations tend to shield the electric charge. The farther one is from a charge the smaller its effective charge appears. The main effect being that as one increases the resolution of the scattering experiment the virtual photon penetrates more and more into the cloud of virtual particles-antiparticles that surround the charge, revealing a larger and larger charge. The net effect is that the electro-magnetic coupling strength is increasing as the energy increases.</p>
            <p>On the contrary the strong force is <em>anti-screening</em>. The strength of the interaction increases with the distance. One dramatic consequence is that colour charged particles cannot be observed in isolation: to separate two colour charges it would take an infinite amount of energy, and before this is reached a colour-anticolour pair can be created from the vacuum, so that we never manage to create a large distance between colour charges. This is illustrated below.</p>

            <p>The experimental consequence is that only globally colour neutral particles can be observed.</p>
