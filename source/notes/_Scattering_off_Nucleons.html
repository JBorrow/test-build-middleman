<h1 id="scattering-off-nucleons">Scattering off nucleons</h1>
<p>We have seen elastic scattering off nuclei, we would now like to concentrate on the properties of the components of the nucleus: the proton and neutrons. Given that their size is of the order of <span class="math inline">\(1\rm{fm}\)</span> we need electrons with energy <span class="math inline">\(q=1/1\rm{fm}\simeq 200\,\rm{MeV}\)</span> which is not negligible compared with the nucleon mass <span class="math inline">\(M\simeq 938\,\rm{MeV}\)</span>. Luckily the changes for the Mott cross section are not big: a) one needs to replace the momentum transfer <span class="math inline">\(\vec{q}\)</span> with a Lorentz invariant quantity <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[{\mathbf{q}}\rightarrow q=p-p&#39;=(E-E&#39;,{\mathbf{p}}-{\mathbf{p&#39;}})\;,\quad {\mathbf{q}}^2\rightarrow -q^2=-(E-E&#39;)^2+({\mathbf{p}}-{\mathbf{p&#39;}})^2\equiv Q^2\]</span> since the invariant mass <span class="math inline">\(q^2\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is negative we use <span class="math inline">\(Q^2=-q^2\)</span> so that we have a positive quantity. b) one needs to multiply the cross section with <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;/E\)</span>, this is due to the fact that the density of final states must now take the momentum of the recoiling nucleon into account. So the cross section taking the recoil into account is given in the high energy limit by <span class="math display">\[\left.\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right|_{\rm{with}\;\rm{recoil}}
=
\frac{\alpha^2}{4E^2\sin^4\frac{\theta}{2}}
\left(
\frac{E&#39;}{E}\right)
\left[
\cos^2\frac{\theta}{2}+\frac{Q^2}{2M^2}\sin^2\frac{\theta}{2}\right]
=
\left.\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right|_{\rm{Mott}} \left[
1+2\tau\tan^2\frac{\theta}{2}\right]\;.\]</span> with <span class="math display">\[\tau=\frac{Q^2}{4M^2}\]</span> The term proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\tan^2\theta/2\)</span> is caused by the magnetic interaction of the electron current with the magnetic moment of the nucleon, which is given by <span class="math display">\[\mu=g\frac{e}{2M}\frac{1}{2}\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(g=2\)</span> for a spin <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> fermion (it is a consequence of the Dirac equation). The interaction through this term is accompanied by a flip of the spin of the nucleon, so we have the opposite situation as earlier where angular momentum restricted the large angle scattering.</p>
<p><img src="/images/scattering180b" alt="When a spin flip of the nucleon is allowed the large angle scattering is allowed and the small angle one is forbidden." />{#}</p>
<p>This formula is valid for the nucleon when treated as a point-like object. Since we want to investigate the structure of the nucleon we will make the same step as when we investigated the charge distribution inside a nucleus. Calculating the cross section for an object with a finite size will modify the cross section in the same way as before: it will be multiplied by the square of the Fourier transform of the distribution. This time both the electric and magnetic interaction are important, so we will need both the Fourier transform of the charge distribution and that of the magnetic moment.</p>
<p>The result is called the Rosenbluth formula. It describes the relativistic scattering of an electron off a target with a spatial electric charge density and a spatial magnetic moment density. <span class="math display">\[\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_{\rm  Mott} \left[\frac{G^2_E(Q^2)+\tau G^2_M(Q^2)}{1+\tau}+2\tau G^2_M(Q^2)\tan^2\frac{\theta}{2}\right]\;,\quad \tau=\frac{Q^2}{4M^2_p}\;,\]</span> we now have two form factors, <span class="math inline">\(G_E(Q^2)\)</span> is related to the Fourier transform of the electric charge density, while <span class="math inline">\(G_M(Q^2)\)</span> is the form factor associated with the magnetic moment density. The derivation of this formula is beyond the remit of the course. If we set the magnetic form factor to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> we recover the formula for the scattering off an electric charge density (with relativistic factors now). We also see that the angular dependence (beyond the kinematical one brought by <span class="math inline">\(1/q^4\)</span>) comes only with the magnetic form factor <span class="math inline">\(G_M(Q^2)\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the nucleons were point-like we would find that the form factors <span class="math inline">\(G_E(Q^2)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G_M(Q^2)\)</span> would be constant. Since they are not, we will observe the same fall-off at values of <span class="math inline">\(Q^2\)</span> of the order of the inverse spacial extend of the probe <span class="math inline">\(Q\simeq 1/R\)</span>. One way of seeing this effect is that when <span class="math inline">\(Q^2\)</span> is very large the scattering particle only interacts with a small part of the probe, for example with a small portion of the charge and hence the cross section is diminished.</p>
<p>For small values of <span class="math inline">\(Q^2\ll 1/R^2\)</span> the nucleon appears to be a point-like particle and we should recover the point-like result. We find for the proton: <span class="math display">\[G_E^p(Q^2=0)=1\;,\quad G_M^p(Q^2=0)=2.79\]</span> the first value is as expected the charge of the proton, but the value of <span class="math inline">\(G_M\)</span> would be <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> for a Dirac particle of spin <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span>. The fact that it is not the case is due to the fact that the proton has an internal structure and its response to a magnetic field is not as simple as that of a structure-less Dirac particle. For the neutron we find: <span class="math display">\[G_E^p(Q^2=0)=0\;,\quad G_M^p(Q^2=0)=-1.91\;,\]</span> where again the electric form factor <span class="math inline">\(G_E\)</span> tends for low <span class="math inline">\(Q^2\)</span> towards the charge of the nucleon, and the magnetic moment shows that the neutron has an internal structure.</p>

<p>The form factors are measured for a fixed value of <span class="math inline">\(Q^2\)</span> by looking at the <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> dependence of the ratio <span class="math display">\[\frac{
\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_{\rm exp}
}{
\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_{\rm  Mott}
}\]</span> and fitting the coefficients <span class="math inline">\(G_E(Q^2)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G_M(Q^2)\)</span>. This is illustrated in the figure on the right: The intersection of the fit with the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis corresponds to <span class="math display">\[\frac{G^2_E(Q^2)+\tau G^2_M(Q^2)}{1+\tau}\]</span> and the slope is <span class="math display">\[2\tau G^2_M(Q^2)\;.\]</span> We can now plot the values of the form factors <span class="math inline">\(G_E(Q^2)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G_M(Q^2)\)</span>. An example of the <span class="math inline">\(Q^2\)</span> dependence of the form factors is shown in Figure fig. 5.</p>

<p>We can see in this Figure that the form factor is not constant and has a dependence on <span class="math inline">\(Q^2\)</span>. The dependence on <span class="math inline">\(Q^2\)</span> can be used to infer the distribution of charge and magnetic moment in the nucleon. For the proton electric form factor and the magnetic form factor of both nucleon the <span class="math inline">\(Q^2\)</span> dependence can be described well by a dipole form <span class="math display">\[G(q^2)\simeq\frac{1}{1+q^2/a^2}\;.\]</span> Looking at Figure fig. 3 we can infer that the charge and magnetic moments are distributed according to and exponentially falling distribution. It is also noteworthy that the electric form factor of the neutron is not completely vanishing, as one would expect if there were no charge in the neutron. We will see later that the neutron is composed of quarks which carry charges and their spatial charge distribution is not completely vanishing but cancel exactly when integrated over the neutron volume.</p>
<h1 id="from-quantum-mechanics-to-quantum-field-theory">From Quantum Mechanics to Quantum Field Theory</h1>
<p>So far we have considered the scattering problem in a quantum mechanical way. We have computed the overlap between initial and final state wave functions given an interaction potential. This description only works for the simplest problems. To describe particle physics accurately we need to overcome a serious limitation of the QM description, namely that the number of particle is conserved.</p>
<p>In a typical particle collision some particle annihilate and new particles are created so we need to be able to create new states instead of just observing the evolution of a given state to another one. Quantum field theory is an appropriate description for particle collisions where new particles are created but it is beyond the remit of this course. In this section we describe some of the implications of QFT.</p>

<p>The left-hand panel illustrates the scattering off a potential. The right-hand side illustrate the scattering as describe in QFT where the interaction is &quot;quantised&quot; and mediated through a virtual particle.</p>
</div>
<p>In Quantum mechanics the interaction is described by a potential that acts “continuously” on the state. In QFT the interaction is “quantised” and the action of the force is mediated by particles. In the example of the electro-magnetic force the mediator is the photon.</p>

<p>The particle exchange is a quantum mechanical effect and cannot be observed directly, only its effect is visible through the momentum that is transferred. Because it is not detectable the particle exchanged is called <span class="math inline">\(virtual\)</span>.</p>
<p>As they are not observed virtual particles can violate the relationship <span class="math inline">\(p^2=m^2\)</span> between their four-momentum and their mass. According to the uncertainty principle such a violation of the energy relation can only last for a time inverse proportional to the size of the energy difference.</p>
<p>In general a process involving a virtual particle will have a factor in its amplitude inverse proportional to the violation of then mass relation. <span class="math display">\[
