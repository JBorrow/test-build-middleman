<h2 id="parton-model">Parton model</h2>
<p>Given the relative independence of the structure function we are led to think that there is a point-like structure within the nucleon. This is the starting point of the parton model: the nucleon is composed of point-like constituents called partons, and the inelastic scattering with the nucleon is actually an elastic scattering with one of the partons.</p>
<p>The kinematics in this model is shown in Figure fig. 9. The incoming and outgoing electrons have momenta <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p&#39;\)</span>, the proton has momentum <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> before the scattering and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> after scattering. The momentum transferred by the virtual photon is <span class="math inline">\(Q^2=-q^2\)</span>. We now assume that the reaction actually takes part between the virtual photon and a parton that carries a fraction <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;\eta&lt;1\)</span> of the momentum of the proton.</p>

<p>If we assume that the parton is massless we can calculate its momentum fraction <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> by computing the square of the outgoing parton momentum <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[0=k^2=\left(\eta P+p-p&#39;\right)^2=\left(\eta P+q\right)^2=\eta^2M^2+2\eta P\cdot q-Q^2\]</span> If we assume that the energies in the process are much larger than the proton mass we can neglect the <span class="math inline">\(M^2\)</span> term and solve for <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\eta=\frac{Q^2}{2P\cdot q}=x\]</span></p>

</div>
<p>Now we have a more physical interpretation of the kinematical parameter <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>: it is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the parton that is struck in the scattering. This interpretation is only valid in the limits mentioned above but are applicable in practice. We can now go back to the right-most sketch in Figure fig. 7 and give an interpretation of the peak at <span class="math inline">\(x\simeq 1/3\)</span>: it means that we have the highest cross section for a scattering with a parton that carries about a third of the total proton momentum, so we are lead to believe that the proton is composed of three objects.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(F_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F_2\)</span> structure functions encapsulate information about the electric and magnetic properties of the constituents of the nucleons. If these constituents are spin <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> particles then there is a relationship between <span class="math inline">\(F_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F_2\)</span> called the Callan-Gross relation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
F_2(x,Q^2)=2xF_1(x,Q^2)\;.
\qquad(9)\]</span> Figure fig. 10 shows the ration of the left and right-hand side of equation eq. 9. The fact that the data is consistent with the ratio being <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is evidence that the constituents of the nucleon are spin <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> particles. These particles are called <em>quarks</em> and we an study their properties by studying the structure functions.</p>

</div>
<p>We now have the elements we need to formulate the parton model: the inelastic scattering cross section if given by the sum of the cross section of the elastic scattering off the constituents <span class="math display">\[
\frac{d\sigma}{dQ^2\, dx}=\sum\limits_{\mbox{constituents}} f_c(x) \frac{d\sigma}{dQ^2}(e^-,c;p,xP,p&#39;) \qquad(10)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f_c(x)\)</span> is the number density of the constituent <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, that is the number of partons of type <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> with momentum fraction in an infinitesimal interval around <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[dn_c(x)=f_c(s)\,dx\;.\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(f_c(x)\)</span> is called a parton distribution function and we will discuss them in more detail in section sec. 8.5. To simplify the notation it is often written as <span class="math inline">\(c(x)\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(f_c(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Equation eq. 10 gives a prediction of the cross section for the parton model, if we compare this to the form in equation eq. 8 we get the parton model prediction for the structure functions. Since the structure function can be measured in collider experiment we can learn something about the partons.</p>
<p>The cross section for the electron scattering off one constituent is proportional to the charge squared of the constituent. One can show (see workshop problem 5) that the structure function <span class="math inline">\(F_2\)</span> is given by: <span class="math display">\[F_2(x)=x\sum\limits_{constituents}Q_c^2f_c(x)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(Q_c\)</span> is the charge of constituent <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, the sum runs over all charged constituents.</p>
<h2 id="partons">Partons</h2>
<p>In this section we discuss the two types of partons: the quarks and gluons. The facts described here were gathered through deep inelastic scattering experiments and hadron spectroscopy.</p>
<h3 id="quarks">Quarks</h3>
<p>Quarks are spin <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> fermions. They come in six different types called <em>flavour</em>, shown in the table below.</p>

<p>Each quark has an anti-particle called anti-quark (denoted by a bar above the symbol) with the opposite charge.</p>
<p>The nucleons are composed of three <em>valence</em> quarks. The proton is <span class="math inline">\(uud\)</span> quark combination and the neutron is a <span class="math inline">\(udd\)</span> quark combination. They are the most common example of a bound state of three quarks, which are called <em>baryons</em>. There are also bound states of a quark and an anti-quark called <span class="math inline">\(mesons\)</span>. Both families of particles will be covered in detail in a later chapter.</p>
<p>The valence quark give the nucleons their overall quantum numbers. One can easily check that the charge of the proton and neutron is given by the sum of the charges of their valence quarks.</p>
<p>The quarks are interacting through the strong force. As the forces in particle physics the force is mediated through the exchange of a virtual particle. The force carrier of the strong interaction is called the gluon and will be discussed in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="gluons">gluons</h3>
<p>Gluons are the carriers of the strong force, they play the same role for the strong force as the the photon for the electro-magnetic force. Unlike photons, the gluons also interact with each other, this leads to a different behaviour of the coupling strength of the strong and electro-magnetic force. The gluons have no electric charge so they do not interact with the photons, so they are invisible when we perform our deep inelastic scattering experiment.</p>
<h3 id="sea-quarks">Sea quarks</h3>
<p>The quarks in the proton are held together by the strong force through exchange of gluons. During the exchange the gluon can split into a virtual quark-anti-quark pair. These quarks and anti-quarks, unlike the gluons, are not invisible to the virtual photon emitted by the incoming electron. These quarks always come in pairs and their quantum numbers cancel and therefore do not contribute to the quantum numbers of the nucleon.</p>
<h2 id="sec:pdf">Parton distribution functions</h2>
<p>The parton distribution function give the number density of the partons in the proton (there are also PDFs for other baryons or mesons.) The PDFs depend on the fraction <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> of the proton momentum they are carrying. The PDFs cannot be predicted from first principle but there are theoretical constraints on their integrals. One of them is that the total contribution of the charged quarks should reproduce the quantum numbers of the proton. For example the charge of the proton has to be <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\int\limits_0^1\sum\limits_{q}Q_qf_q(x)\,dx=1\,.\]</span> The sum runs over all quarks and anti-quarks only, as gluons have no electric charge. <span class="math inline">\(Q_q\)</span> is the charge of the quark. We also want that the sum of all momentum fractions add up to the total momentum of the proton: <span class="math display">\[\int\limits_0^1\sum\limits_{c} x\,f_c(x)\,dx=1\,.\]</span> Here the sum over <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> runs over all quarks, anti-quark and gluons as all carry some momentum.</p>
<p>The quarks found in the proton have two possible origins. First they can be one of the three quarks that give the proton its baryon properties as a <span class="math inline">\(uud\)</span> bound state, these quarks are called valence quarks. Secondly they can be a quark or anti-quark created as part of the cloud of virtual particles surrounding the valence quarks. We distinguish the two types of quarks with a valence PDF and a “sea” distribution <span class="math display">\[f_q(x)=f_q^V(x)+f_q^S(x)\;.\]</span></p>
<p>To help imagining what the PDFs are it is helpful to think about how they would look like if the structure of the proton was much easier. If there were only the three valence quarks and each of the three quarks carried exactly one third of the momentum of the proton we would get the results of Fig.fig. 13</p>

<p>Figure 11: PDF distributions if there were only the three valence quarks and they all had one third of the momentum of the proton. The left-hand plot is for the <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> quark and the right-had plot for the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> quark.</p>
</div>
<p>In this case the PDFs would be simple delta functions fixing the momentum fraction to <span class="math inline">\(1/3\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> PDF is normalised such that it gives <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> when integrated over <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, since we have two valence <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> quarks and the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> PDF integrates to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Another example shown in Fig fig. 12 is in the hypothetical case where we only have valence quarks and the two <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> quarks have to share half the momentum of the proton and the single <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> quark carries the other half. The momentum fractions of the <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> quark are not fixed to <span class="math inline">\(1/4\)</span> as one of the quark can have a larger share of the <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> of the proton momentum as long as the other one. The area under the <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> PDF curve still has to be equal to he number of valence <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> quarks.</p>

<p>Figure 12: PDF distributions if there were only the three valence quarks and the two <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> quarks share half of the momentum while the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> quark carries the rest of the momentum of the proton. The left-hand plot is for the <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> quark and the right-had plot for the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> quark.</p>
</div>
<p>One can now move to a more general parametrisation. Let us see how a PDF would look like if it is of the form <span class="math display">\[f(x)=x^a(1-x)^b\;,\qquad a,b&gt;0\;.\]</span> This form has some nice properties. The PDF vanishes for <span class="math inline">\(x\rightarrow 0\)</span>, which is what we would expect for valence quarks: it is not very likely that a valence quark carries a very small fraction of the proton’s momentum. The PDF also vanishes when <span class="math inline">\(x\rightarrow 1\)</span> which is the limit in which the parton described by the PDF carries all of the momentum of the proton, leaving almost nothing to the other partons.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/images/PDFs.png" alt="Figure 13: PDF distributions of the form x^a(1-x)^b. The expectation value \langle x\rangle gives the average fraction of the proton momentum a quark with this PDF would carry." id="fig:pdfab" />
<p class="caption">Figure 13: PDF distributions of the form <span class="math inline">\(x^a(1-x)^b\)</span>. The expectation value <span class="math inline">\(\langle x\rangle\)</span> gives the average fraction of the proton momentum a quark with this PDF would carry.</p>
</div>
<p>So far we have focused on the valence quarks. The sea quarks typically carry a small fraction of the proton momentum. Their PDFs vanish very quickly for <span class="math inline">\(x-&gt;1\)</span> but do not vanish at <span class="math inline">\(x\rightarrow 0\)</span>. The gluons also tend to carry a lower fraction of the proton momentum than the quarks, but their contribution becomes dominant at small values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, as shown in Fig. fig. 14.</p>
<p>The PDFs cannot be predicted solely by theoretical methods and have to be measured experimentally. The most common method to do so is to create an ansatz such as the one we had above (<span class="math inline">\(f(x)=x^a(1-x)^b\)</span>) and fit the parameters (<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in our example)</p>
