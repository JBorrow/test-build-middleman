<h2 id="decay-constants">Decay constants</h2>
<p>If a substance is made of atoms which have a probability <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> of decaying per time unit, the change of the number of atoms is given by <span class="math display">\[\frac{dN}{dt}=-\lambda N\;,\qquad\Rightarrow \quad N=N_0 e^{-\lambda t}\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is called the decay constant. If we want to obtain the mean life we consider the number of decays in a small time interval <span class="math inline">\(dt\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(dN=\lambda N(t)\,dt\)</span> these decays happen at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> so in order to get the mean of the time before decay we need to weight this number of decays by the time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, to take all atoms into account we integrate over <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> and normalise by the total number of atoms: <span class="math display">\[\tau\equiv&lt;t&gt;=\frac{1}{N_0}\int\limits_{0}^{N_0} t dN =\frac{1}{N_0}\int\limits_0^\infty t \lambda N_0 e^{-\lambda t}\,dt=-\lambda\int\limits_0^\infty\frac{1}{-\lambda}e^{-\lambda t}=\frac{1}{\lambda}\]</span> the mean time before decay is called the lifetime. Another time describing the decay is the so-called half time. It is defined as the time after which half of the elements of the sample will have decayed. It is different from the lifetime but is related through <span class="math display">\[e^{-\lambda t_{1/2}}=\frac12 \quad\Rightarrow \quad t_{1/2}=\frac{\ln(2)}{\lambda}=\tau \ln(2)\]</span> Figure fig. 3 shows the exponential decay of the number of nuclei and the lifetime and half time.</p>

<p>The frequency of decays in a material is called the <em>activity</em> <span class="math display">\[A=-\frac{dN}{dt}=\lambda N\]</span> Commonly used units for the activity are Becquerel (<span class="math inline">\(1 Bq=1\;\mbox{decay}/s\)</span>) or Curie (<span class="math inline">\(1 Ci=3.7\cdot 10^{10}\;\rm Bq\)</span>). The activity of a sample decreases with time as the number of candidate nuclei for a decay diminishes. <span class="math display">\[A(t)=\lambda N(t)=\lambda N_0 e^{-\lambda t}\;.\]</span> To measure the lifetime of a substance one can either measure the time dependence of the activity or use the definition, the former only practical for relatively short-lived nuclei and the latter requiring a good knowledge of the number of nuclei of a given substance in the sample.</p>
<h2 id="beta-decay"><span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-decay</h2>
<p>As a free particle the neutron has a lifetime of about <span class="math inline">\(881.5\,\rm{s}\)</span> and decays into a proton, an electron and a neutrino through the weak force. <span class="math display">\[
n\rightarrow p+e^-+\bar{\nu}_e
\qquad(2)\]</span> this process is called a <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> decay and it explains why there is no free neutrons while there are free protons (in hydrogen atoms). Neutron can be long lived when they are part of a bound state in a nucleus. Neutrons in the nucleus can still decay into protons if it is energetically favoured. In fact the opposite effect can also happen if the nucleus resulting from a proton changing into a neutron is less massive. This can be the case since loosing a proton reduces the Coulomb energy and depending on the neutron-proton imbalance may result in the newly created neutron taking a lower energy state than the proton. Nuclei with large number of protons will tend to exchange protons for neutrons and nuclei with large numbers of neutrons compared to protons will tend to exchange protons for neutrons. This processes called <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-decay do not change the mass number <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> but changes <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>.</p>
<p>Three processes are possible, all using variations of the <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-decay formula (eq. 2) by moving particles between final and initial state. All of them include neutrinos whose mass can be neglected. We will talk about neutrinos in greater details later.</p>
<dl>
<dt><span class="math inline">\(\beta^-\)</span> decay:</dt>
<dd><p>A neutron in the nucleus decays into a proton, an electron and an electron anti-neutrino. <span class="math display">\[n\rightarrow p+e^-+\bar{\nu}_e\]</span> Such a decay is possible if the mass difference between the parent and daughter nuclei is large enough to “afford” the creation of the electron an neutrino. In terms of atom masses the condition is : <span class="math display">\[M(Z,A) &gt; M(Z+1,A)\]</span> where the fact that we use atom masses takes the additional electron produced in the decay into account since the daughter nucleus has one more electron than the parent.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="math inline">\(\beta^+\)</span> decay:</dt>
<dd><p>A proton in the nucleus is changed into a neutron by emitting a positron and a neutrino: <span class="math display">\[p\rightarrow n+e^++\nu_e\]</span> For this process to happen the mass difference between the nuclei should be large enough to “buy” the mass of the positron. In terms of atomic masses the condition is <span class="math display">\[M(Z,A) &gt; M(Z-1,A) + 2m_e\]</span> we need to add twice the mass of the electron on the right-hand side, once to get the mass of the positron, and once to make up for the fact that the nucleus on the left-hand side has <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> electrons and the one on the right-hand side has <span class="math inline">\(Z-1\)</span> electrons.</p>
</dd>
<dt>electron capture:</dt>
<dd><p>in this case we consider the case in which an electron from the atom combines with a proton to give a neutron and a neutrino: <span class="math display">\[p+e^-\rightarrow n+\nu_e\]</span> for this process to occur the condition is less stringent because no energy is needed to produce a positron or electron, only the (negligible) energy for the neutrino is needed. The condition is <span class="math display">\[M(Z,A)&gt; M(Z-1,A)+\epsilon\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is the energy of the excited state of the nuclide <span class="math inline">\(\ce{^{A}_{Z-1}X}\)</span> produced. For this process to happen there needs to be some overlap between the electron wave function and the nucleus. This is more likely to be the case for <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-shell electron since there the radial wave function has a non-zero value at the origin. Also the higher the charge of the nucleus the closer the electron wave function is concentrated close to the nucleus, so electron capture gets more likely for larger nuclei. Electron capture is always possible when <span class="math inline">\(\beta^+\)</span>-decay is allowed but the reverse is not true: if the mass difference between two isobars is smaller than <span class="math inline">\(2m_e\)</span> only electron capture is possible.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since these decays do not change <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> we can quantify this by looking at the semi-empirical formula eq. eq. 1 for a fixed value of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Substituting <span class="math inline">\(N=A-Z\)</span> we find that the mass formula is quadratic in <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> so we expect the masses of the isobars to fit on a parabola.</p>

<p><img src="/images/isobar77.png" id="fig:isobars0" style="width:50.0%" /> <img src="/images/isobar80.png" id="fig:isobars1" style="width:50.0%" /></p>

</div>
<p>In the case of odd <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> we have one parabola, as shown in Figure fig. 4. In such a case only one isobar is the lowest and is <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-stable. All other isobars can decay to that stable isobar.</p>
<p>In the case of even <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> nuclei there are two parabolas because of the pairing term. An example is shown in Figure fig. 4. In some cases we are in a situation where there are two nuclides of the even-even type lower than a nuclide of odd-odd type.</p>
<h2 id="alpha-decay"><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay</h2>
<p>Another possibility for decay is the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay where an <span class="math inline">\(\ce{^4He}\)</span> nucleus, also called <span class="math inline">\(alpha\)</span>-particle is emitted. This decay reduces <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> by two units and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> by four. For this decay to happen the mass of the atom must satisfy (neglecting the electron mass): <span class="math display">\[M(Z,A)&gt; M(Z-2,A-4)+M(2,4)\]</span></p>
<p>To investigate the alpha decay we consider an <span class="math inline">\(alpha\)</span>-particle within a nucleus for which alpha decay is allowed. The potential the particle is experiencing is sketched on the left-hand side of Figure fig. 5. Outside of the nucleus (that is further than the range of the nuclear force) the alpha particle only feels the Coulomb potential of the daughter nucleus. Inside the nucleus the Coulomb potential is stronger and forms the potential well with boundary at distance <span class="math inline">\(r\simeq R\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay proceeds through tunnelling through the Coulomb potential barrier. Since the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay occurs through tunnelling the dependence of the decay time on the energy is exponential, which explains why the lifetimes for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay cover a very wide range of timescales.</p>

<h2 id="nuclear-fission">Nuclear fission</h2>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-decay is only one case in which the nucleus splits into several smaller nuclei. If we look at the energy as we pull the two parts of a nucleus apart we can sketch the potential for the distance of the two part as a function of the distance. Starting from the ground state of the parent nucleus (which we assume to be spherically symmetric) we start stretching the nucleus, this increases the surface energy, because at fixed inner volume, the sphere is the surface with the smallest surface to volume ratio. The Coulomb potential energy on the other hand decreases, eventually dominating the surface energy and the two parts separate. The potential is shown on the right-hand side of Figure fig. 5</p>

</div>
<p>The height of the barrier is called the activation energy. Very few nuclides decay through spontaneous fission, in most cases <span class="math inline">\(alpha\)</span>-decay is more likely (see Figure fig. 6). The probability of fission increases with <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> and is more likely for heavy nuclides. Fission processes can be induced by exposing the nuclides to a flux of neutrons. If an atom absorbs a neutron it will acquire its kinetic energy (although part of it will be needed to produce the daughter nucleus recoil) and it also gains the bounding energy associated with the additional neutron. This additional energy can bring the nucleus energy above the fission barrier, triggering the fission of the nucleus.</p>
<p>Fission is not the only way a nucleus excited through neutron absorption can decay in a stable state. It can also do so through the emission of a photon. This process is called radiative capture. Figure fig. 7 shows the cross section for the absorption of a neutron by two isotopes of uranium. Neutrons with energies below the region with the resonances are called called “slow”, neutrons with energies above the resonance region are called “fast”. For <span class="math inline">\(\ce{^{235}U}\)</span> the fission cross section is larger than that for radiative capture which means that a neutron is most likely to trigger a fission. For <span class="math inline">\(\ce{^{238}U}\)</span> the situation is different, for energies below about <span class="math inline">\(1\;\rm{MeV}\)</span> absorption is most likely happening radiatively, while fission only occurs for energies higher that about <span class="math inline">\(1\;\rm{MeV}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Fission of a heavy nucleus usually result in neutron-rich daughter nuclei, some free neutrons and kinetic energy. In the fission of <span class="math inline">\(\ce{^{235}U}\)</span> these neutrons have energies with a peak slightly lower than <span class="math inline">\(1\;\rm{MeV}\)</span>. In pure <span class="math inline">\(\ce{^{235}U}\)</span> these neutron can be absorbed by another uranium nucleus that will most likely trigger a new fission. Since the number of neutrons released is larger than one this can generate a chain reaction where the number of neutrons available to trigger a new fission increases exponentially until the residual thermal caused by the kinetic energy of the daughter nuclei cannot be contained. This is the principle of an atomic bomb.</p>
<p>The fuel used in a nuclear reactor is not pure <span class="math inline">\(\ce{^{235}U}\)</span> but is a mixture of the two uranium isotopes, closer to their natural occurrences (<span class="math inline">\(\ce{^{238}U}\)</span>: 99%,<span class="math inline">\(\ce{^{235}U}\)</span>: 0.7%). If nothing is done to prevent it, secondary neutrons from the fission of an <span class="math inline">\(\ce{^{235}U}\)</span> atom will be in most cases absorbed through radiative capture by <span class="math inline">\(\ce{^{238}U}\)</span> and no chain reaction can be sustained. The idea in a nuclear reactor is to “cool” the neutrons from the fission to energies below the resonance region (where the fission of <span class="math inline">\(\ce{^{235}U}\)</span> is dominant) so that they are available to trigger new fissions. The way neutrons can be cooled is to let them propagate through a medium that will not absorb them, but will reduce their kinetic through elastic scatterings. Such a medium is called a moderator. The ideal properties of a moderator is that it should not absorb neutrons easily and it should be efficient at reducing the kinetic energy of the neutrons. The first property is fulfilled by materials rich in neutron. For the second property we want that the free neutron loses as much energy as possible at each elastic scattering. This is best obtained for light nuclei (in the case of an extremely heavy nuclei the neutron energy would not change at all). Graphite (carbon) and heavy water (<span class="math inline">\(D_2O\)</span>) are good moderators used in practice. The arrangement depicted in Figure fig. 8 that allows for a sustained reaction is to have fissible fuel separated in a volume of moderator.</p>
