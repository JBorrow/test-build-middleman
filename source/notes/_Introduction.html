<p>To study the properties of a particle one can bombard it with other particles and analyse the distribution of the deflected particles in a similar fashion to optical or X-ray spectroscopy.</p>
<p>We distinguish between<br />
<span>0.5</span><span><strong>elastic scattering</strong></span> where the scattering particles escape unscathed from the reaction, that is they are the same particles but with different energy and momenta.</p>

<p><br />
<span>0.5</span> <span><strong>inelastic scattering</strong></span> where at least one of the particles is changed, destroyed or more particles are created.</p>
