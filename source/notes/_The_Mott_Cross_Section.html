<p>So far we have neglected the spin effects. If we include the effect of the spin of the electron (but still neglect the nucleus recoil) we get the Mott cross section <span class="math display">\[
\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_{\rm{Mott,no\; recoil}}=\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_{\rm{Rutherford}}\left(1-\beta^2\sin^2\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\qquad(3)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\beta=v/c\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> the velocity of the electron. In the high energy limit <span class="math inline">\(\beta\simeq 1\)</span> so that we get <span class="math display">\[\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_{\rm{Mott,no\; recoil}}=\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_{\rm{Rutherford}}\cos^2\frac{\theta}{2}\]</span> The spin effect is to reduce the cross section as the scattering angle increases. In the extreme case of backward scattering <span class="math inline">\(\theta=180^\circ\)</span> the differential cross section vanishes. The reason for this effect is that for relativistic spin <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> fermions with <span class="math inline">\(\beta=1\)</span> the spin measured in the direction of motion is conserved, in other words the helicity <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> <span class="math display">\[h=\frac{{\mathbf{s}}\cdot{\mathbf{p}}}{|{\mathbf{s}}||{\mathbf{p}}|}\]</span> cannot change. In the case of backward scattering if the spin of the incoming particle was aligned with its direction (say along the <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>-axis) after scattering it would have to be pointing along the opposite direction, since this is the direction of the recoiled electron and helicity is conserved. But in this case angular momentum would not be conserved! If the angle is not <span class="math inline">\(180^\circ\)</span> then there is an overlap between the wave function of the incoming and outgoing electrons with spins aligned with their momenta. This overlap increases as the directions of the incoming and outgoing particles get more and more aligned.</p>
